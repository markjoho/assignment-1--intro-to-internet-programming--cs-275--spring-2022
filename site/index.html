    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Good design…</p>
      <p>Is innovative. The possibilities for progression are not, by any
        means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new
        opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always
        develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an
        end in itself.</p>
      <p>Makes a product useful. A product is bought to be used. It has to
        satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic
        criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst
        disregarding anything that could detract from it.</p>
      <p>Is aesthetic. The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its
        usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on
        people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be
        beautiful.</p>
      <p>Makes a product understandable. It clarifies the product’s structure.
        Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by
        making use of the user’s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>
      <p>Is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are
        neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should
        therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s
        self-expression.</p>
      <p>Is honest. It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful
        or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the
        consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
      <p>Is long-lasting. It avoids being fashionable and therefore never
        appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years — 
        even in today’s throwaway society.</p>
      <p>Is thorough down to the last detail. Nothing must be arbitrary or left
        to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards
        the consumer.</p>
      <p>Is environmentally friendly. Design makes an important contribution to
        the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and
        minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of
        the product.</p>
      <p>Is as little design as possible. Less, but better — because it
        concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened
        with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</p>
